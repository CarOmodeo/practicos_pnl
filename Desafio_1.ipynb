Los ajustes realizados en los parámetros del vectorizador y el clasificador permitieron capturar mejor las relaciones entre términos y documentos, mostrando que el enfoque es adecuado para el problema planteado. Sin embargo, aún existe margen de mejora mediante técnicas adicionales de preprocesamiento o modelos más avanzados."
